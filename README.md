# RP Menu

A menu with a focus on role play, with features such as GM requests, voice ranges, teleporting, no clip, spawning items, and permissions.

# Installing

(It's not actually published as a package yet, but once it is the following applies.)

Head to my [VCC Listing](https://jansharp.github.io/vrc/vcclisting.xhtml) and follow the instructions there.

Also make sure to add [Sylan's Listing](https://sylantroh.github.io/SylanVCC/) since this package depends on the Audio Manager.

# Contributing

This project uses [custom git filters](.gitattributes) to reduce the amount of noise generated by Udon and UdonSharp. These filters are not required in order to contribute, though without them all UdonSharp asset files will show as modified and those "changes" should not be committed.

# Licenses

It includes third party code from the following sources and licenses:
